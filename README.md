## Project Overview
Smuggler's Town is a multiplayer, real-time, capture-the-flag racing game. Players drive cars on a real-world map, pick up contraband, and race to deliver it to their base while avoiding or battling other players. The game is designed for fast, fun, and accessible play in the browser.

## Features
- Real-world map gameplay (MapLibre + OSM tiles)
- Fast-paced car physics and controls
- Capture-the-flag mechanics
- Server-authoritative multiplayer (Colyseus)
- Real-time car movement and state sync
- Modern, responsive UI (React + Tailwind)
- Pixi.js overlay for smooth 2D graphics

## Architecture
- **Client**: React SPA, Pixi.js for game rendering, Zustand for state, Tailwind for UI
- **Server**: Node.js, Colyseus for real-time rooms, zod for schema validation
- **Data flow**: Client sends input diffs, server simulates and broadcasts state, client interpolates and renders
- **World model**: Meter-based coordinates, converted to lat/lng for map overlay

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Pixi.js, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, MapLibre
- **Backend**: Node.js, Colyseus, zod
- **Other**: OpenStreetMap tiles, FastAPI (planned), Monorepo structure
